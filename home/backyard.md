## An Opening?

You hop the fence leading to Sam's backdoor and find that his backyard door is open, you quickly enter and decide to poison everything that's edible in the fridge and leave. All you have to do is wait now. You go home and wait for the news to announce the murders that happened, as soon as the news comes on you can't help but feel your heart racing, waiting to see who drank the poison. "Breaking News! More murders have occured at *Random Address* and a family of 3 have been poisoned. Sadly none have survived and we are working to catch the criminal committing these murders. Rest assured we will stop at nothing to catch them. Please remember to lock your doors and keep your windows shut." After hearing that announcement you go to bed and feel a sense of accomplishment.
