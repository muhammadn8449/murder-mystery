## Really?

You offer you friend a drink but he quickly declines, "Are you serious? You know how the person at the party died right? From poisoning? You just ruined my whole mood, I'mma just head out..." Nice going dude, how could you forget that the person passed from poisoning? Doesn't matter your friend is already out the door and you're left in [solitude](solitude.md).
