## Resist.

As you go to pour the poison in, you stop yourself and think, "What am I doing? I've been friends with him since...Since... I can't remember?" As you think to yourself, a teacher passes by and sees the vial of poison in hand, and quickly calls security to detain you. But you can live in peace knowing you didn't poison Sam, and though you are jailed and charged for the murders that occured, you still can rest easy knowing that you didn't take Sam away from his family and they are still able to see him grow and change as a person.
