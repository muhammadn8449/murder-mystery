As Sam drinks it he had a face of disgust, tasting the bitter and distasteful poison, he grabs at his throat, "I feel like my throat is burning!" After saying that Sam drops to the floor and you call a teacher over, they quickly take him to the nurse but, Sadly he did not make it. After school, Sam's family holds a funeral for him and invite you to make a speech there.
