You ring the bell and Mayor Lozano opens the door and welcomes you and your friends in the party!

[Go for the food?]()
[Go for the drinks?]()

You, Melvin and Timothy go for the food bar and the lights suddenly go off for no reason. You turn on the lights and hear a loud shriek, you quickly run to the scene and find the mayor murdered in the same place where you and your friends are about to eat the food

Mayor Lozano has been stabbed by someone with a sharp blade.

You guys need to solve this mystery.

You use zoomer-view x-ray specs and heat-vision specs to find out who done it.

You found out it was your math teacher Ms. Rider who killed Mayor Lozano and now sheâ€™s making a run for it!

What do you do?
